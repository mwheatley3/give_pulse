## Overview

This app uses Highcharts in order to provide a visual component to the volunteering data that is being collected by Give Pulse.  As of 4/11/2016 the application has 2 graphs.  The first graph shows the type of organizations that have volunteers and the number of hours that each organizationâ€™s members have volunteered.  The second graph displays the discrepancy between the types of skills that are needed at volunteering events and the skills that the volunteers posses.
